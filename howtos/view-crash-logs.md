# How to view user app crash logs from production

This is really cool. You can actually see how your app is crashing for people in production through the app store. Go

```swift
Xcode > Organizer > Crashes 
```

Then click

```swift
iOS App > Release > Open in Project
```

This will show you the actual line of code where you app failed in production. Amazing!
