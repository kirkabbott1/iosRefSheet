# Markdown And Documentation

* **Begin with a summary** that describes the entity being declared. Often, an API can be completely understood from its declaration and its summary.
```swift
/// Returns a "view" of `self` containing the same elements in reverse order. 
func reversed() -> ReverseCollection
```
* **Focus on the summary**; it’s the most important part. Many excellent documentation comments consist of nothing more than a great summary.
* ** Use a single sentence fragment** if possible, ending with a period. Do not use a complete sentence.
* **Describe what a function or method _does_ and what it _returns_**, omitting null effects and `Void` returns
```swift
/// Inserts `newHead` at the beginning of `self`. 
mutating func prepend(_ newHead: Int) 
```
* **Describe what a subscript accesses**
```swift
/// Accesses the `index`th element. 
subscript(index: Int) -> Element { get set }
```
* **Describe what an initializer creates**
```swift
/// Creates an instance containing `n` repetitions of `x`. 
init(count n: Int, repeatedElement x: Element)
```
For all other declarations, **describe what the declared entity _is_**.
```swift
/// A collection that supports equally efficient insertion/removal at any position. 
struct List { 
   /// The element at the beginning of `self`, or `nil` if self is empty. 
   var first: Element?
```
* **Optionally, continue** with one or more paragraphs and bullet items. Paragraphs are separated by blank lines and use complete sentences.
```swift
/// Writes the textual representation of each ← Summary
/// element of `items` to the standard output. 
/// ← Blank line 
/// The textual representation for each item `x` ← Additional discussion 
/// is generated by the expression `String(x)`. 
/// 
/// - Parameter separator: text to be printed between items. 
/// - Parameter terminator: text to be printed at the end.
///
/// - Note: To print without a trailing
/// newline, pass `terminator: ""`
///
/// - SeeAlso: `CustomDebugStringConvertible`,
/// `CustomStringConvertible`, `debugPrint`.
public func print( _ items: Any..., separator: String = " ", terminator: String = "\n")
```
* **Know and use recognized bullet items with** symbol command syntax.Popular development tools such as Xcode give special treatment to bullet items that start with the following keywords:
